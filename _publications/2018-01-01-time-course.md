Obesity represents an important risk factor contributing to the global burden of disease. The current obesogenic 
environment with easy access to calorie‐dense foods is fueling this obesity epidemic. However, how these foods 
contribute to the progression of feeding behavior changes that lead to overeating is not well understood and needs 
systematic assessment. Using novel automated methods for the high‐throughput screening of behavior, we here examine 
mice meal pattern upon long‐term exposure to a free‐choice chocolate‐mixture diet and a high‐fat diet with face 
validity for a rapid development of obesity induced by unhealthy food regularly consumed in our societies. We 
identified rapid diet‐specific behavioral changes after exposure to those high‐caloric diets. Mice fed with high‐fat 
chow, showed long‐lasting meal pattern disturbances, which initiate with a stable loss of circadian feeding 
rhythmicity. Mice receiving a chocolate‐mixture showed qualitatively similar changes, though less marked, consisting 
in a transient disruption of the feeding behavior and the circadian feeding rhytmicity. Strikingly, compulsive‐like 
eating behavior is triggered immediately after exposure to both high‐fat food and chocolate‐mixture diet, well before 
any changes in body weight could be observed. We propose these changes as behavioral biomarkers of prodromal states of 
obesity that could allow early intervention..

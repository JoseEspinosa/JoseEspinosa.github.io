### Abstract

The growing appetite of behavioral neuroscience for automated data production is prompting the need for new 
computational standards allowing improved interoperability, reproducibility, and shareability. We show here how these 
issues can be solved by repurposing existing genomic formats whose structure perfectly supports the handling of time 
series. This allows existing genomic analysis and visualization tools to be deployed onto behavioral data. As a proof 
of principle, we implemented the conversion procedure in Pergola, an open source software, and used genomics tools to 
reproduce results obtained in mouse, fly, and worm. We also show how common genomics techniques such as principal 
component analysis, hidden Markov modeling, and volcano plots can be deployed on the reformatted behavioral data. These 
analyses are easy to share because they depend on the scripting of public software. They are also easy to reproduce 
thanks to their integration within Nextflow, a workflow manager using containerized software.

Obesity is an important health problem with a strong environmental component that is acquiring pandemic proportion. The 
high availability of caloric dense foods promotes overeating potentially causing obesity. Animal models are key to 
validate novel therapeutic strategies, but researchers must carefully select the appropriate model to draw the right 
conclusions. Obesity is defined by an increased body mass index greater than 30 and characterized by an excess of 
adipose tissue. However, the regulation of food intake involves a close interrelationship between homeostatic and 
non-homeostatic factors. Studies in animal models have shown that intermittent access to sweetened or calorie-dense 
foods induces changes in feeding behavior. However, these studies are focused mainly on the final outcome (obesity) 
rather than on the primary dysfunction underlying the overeating of palatable foods. We describe a protocol to study 
overeating in mice using diet-induced obesity (DIO). This method can be applied to free choice between palatable food 
and a standard rodent chow or to forced intake of calorie-dense and/or palatable diets. Exposure to such diets is 
sufficient to promote changes in meal pattern that we register and analyze during the period of weight gain allowing 
the longitudinal characterization of feeding behavior in mice. Abnormal eating behaviors such as binge eating or 
snacking, behavioral alterations commonly observed in obese humans, can be detected using our protocol. In the 
free-choice procedure, mice develop a preference for the rewarding palatable food showing the reinforcing effect of 
this diet. Compulsive components of feeding are reflected by maintenance of feeding despite an adverse bitter taste 
caused by adulteration with quinine and by the negligence of standard chow when access to palatable food is ceased or 
temporally limited. Our strategy also enables to identify compulsive overeating in mice under a high-caloric regime by 
using limited food access and finally, we propose complementary behavioral tests to confirm the non-homeostatic 
food-taking triggered by these foods. Finally, we describe how to computationally explore large longitudinal behavioral 
datasets.

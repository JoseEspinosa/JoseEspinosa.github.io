Down syndrome (DS) individuals present increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and AD-type dementia. 
Here, we investigated the use of green tea extracts containing (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), as co-adjuvant to 
enhance the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) in Ts65Dn mice, a segmental trisomy model of DS that partially 
mimics DS/AD pathology, at the age of initiation of cognitive decline. Classical repeated measures ANOVA showed that 
combined EE-EGCG treatment was more efficient than EE or EGCG alone to improve specific spatial learning related 
variables. Using principal component analysis (PCA) we found that several spatial learning parameters contributed 
similarly to a first PC and explained a large proportion of the variance among groups, thus representing a composite 
learning measure. This PC1 revealed that EGCG or EE alone had no significant effect. However, combined EE-EGCG 
significantly ameliorated learning alterations of middle age Ts65Dn mice. Interestingly, PCA revealed an increased 
variability along learning sessions with good and poor learners in Ts65Dn, and this stratification did not disappear 
upon treatments. Our results suggest that combining EE and EGCG represents a viable therapeutic approach for 
amelioration of age-related cognitive decline in DS, although its efficacy may vary across individuals.

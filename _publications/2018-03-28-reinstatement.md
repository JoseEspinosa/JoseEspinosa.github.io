A major problem in treating obesity is the high rate of relapse to abnormal food-taking habits after maintaining an 
energy balanced diet. Alterations of eating behavior such as compulsive-like behavior and lack of self-control over 
food intake play a critical role in relapse. In this study, we used an operant paradigm of food-seeking behavior on two 
different diet-induced obesity models, a free-choice chocolate-mixture diet and a high-fat diet with face validity for 
a rapid development of obesity or for unhealthy food regularly consumed in our societies. A reduced operant performance 
and motivation for the hedonic value of palatable chocolate pellets was revealed in both obesity mouse models. However, 
only mice exposed to high-fat diet showed an increased compulsive-like behavior in the absence of the reinforcer further 
characterized by impaired operant learning, enhanced impulsivity and intensified inflexibility. We used principal 
component analysis to globally identify the specific behaviors responsible for the differences among diet groups. 
Learning impairment and inflexible behaviors contributed to a first principal component, explaining the largest 
proportion of the variance in the high-fat diet mice phenotype. Reinforcement, impulsion and compulsion were the main 
contributors to the second principal component explaining the differences in the chocolate-mixture mice behavioral 
phenotype. These behaviors were not exclusive of chocolate group because some high-fat individuals showed similar 
values on this component. These data indicate that extended access to hypercaloric diets differentially modifies 
operant behavior learning, behavioral flexibility, impulsive-like and compulsive-like behavior, and these effects were 
dependent on the exposure to each specific diet.

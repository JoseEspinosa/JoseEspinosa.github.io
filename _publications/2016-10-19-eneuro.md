### Abstract

Intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) is accompanied by altered neuro-architecture, deficient synaptic 
plasticity, and excitation-inhibition imbalance in critical brain regions for learning and memory. Recently, we have 
demonstrated beneficial effects of a combined treatment with green tea extract containing 
(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and cognitive stimulation in young adult DS individuals. Although we could 
reproduce the cognitive-enhancing effects in mouse models, the underlying mechanisms of these beneficial effects are 
unknown. Here, we explored the effects of a combined therapy with environmental enrichment (EE) and EGCG in the Ts65Dn 
mouse model of DS at young age. Our results show that combined EE-EGCG treatment improved corticohippocampal-dependent 
learning and memory. Cognitive improvements were accompanied by a rescue of cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) dendritic spine 
density and a normalization of the proportion of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic markers in CA1 and dentate gyrus.

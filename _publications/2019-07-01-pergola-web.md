### Abstract

We present a new web application to query and visualize time-series behavioral data: the Pergola web-server. This 
server provides a user-friendly interface for exploring longitudinal behavioral data taking advantage of the Pergola 
Python library. Using the server, users can process the data applying some basic operations, such as binning or 
grouping, while formatting the data into existing genomic formats. Thanks to this repurposing of genomics standards, 
the application automatically renders an interactive data visualization based on sophisticated genome visualization 
tools. Our tool allows behavioral scientists to share, display and navigate complex behavioral data comprising multiple 
individuals and multiple data types, in a scalable and flexible manner. A download option allows for further analysis 
using genomic tools. The server can be a great resource for the field in a time where behavioral science is entering a 
data-intensive cycle thanks to high-throughput behavioral phenotyping platforms. Pergola is publicly available at 
[http://pergola.crg.eu/](http://pergola.crg.eu/).
